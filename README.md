# About project
1. some times ago i started reading "Maze for programmers" and because its example codes was in ruby so i decided to implement my own maze project with C++. 
2. it needs a lot of work so i will try to put some time on this project and make it better... 
3. I use SFML and CMD to display the maze and i havnt tested this project in platforms other that windows

# Build
Use visual studio 2017 becuase SFML libraries is built with VS15
